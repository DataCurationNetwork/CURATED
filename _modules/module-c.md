<h2>Learning Outcomes</h2>
<b>Curators will be able to:</b><br>

<p> Perform curation actions such as conducting a file inventory and opening the files.
Check the submission for completeness based on a predefined criteria.
Develop preliminary recommendations to be used for the “understand” step. </p>

<h2>Terms to know</h2>

1. <b>Submission information package (SIP)</b> - Items that have been submitted by the depositor.
   <br>
   <br>
2. <b>Archival Information Package (AIP)</b> - A package that contains data that will be stored within a digital archive.
   <br>
   <br>
3. <b>Dissemination Information Package (DIP)</b> - A package created from the AIP to distribute digital content to users.
   <br>
   <br>
4. <b>File inventory</b> - The list of files in the submission information package.
   <br>
   <br>
5. <b>File organization</b> - The act of structuring files in a hierarchical way to ensure findability.
   <br>
   <br>
6. <b>README file</b> - A file that is usually a text file (.txt) or a rich text format file (.rtf) or markdown (.md) that gives information about the creators of the data, where the data was created, methods used to produce the data, sharing privileges, and so on.
   <br>
   <br>
7. <b>Metadata</b> - Data about data. Metadata can include the author, file size, the date the document was created and keywords to describe the document.
<br>
<br>
<br>
<h2>Summary of the Check Step</h2>
The check step is the first step of the CURATED process. In this step, we take an inventory of the contents that have been submitted by the depositor, known in the Open Archival Information System (OAIS) model as the submission information package (SIP). The SIP will become an archival information package (AIP) through the process of curation and a dissemination information package (DIP) through its retrieval by a user. Examples of the contents for SIPs may include: data files, code files, supporting documents, metadata. At this step we are inventorying what has been submitted and noting our initial thoughts. We’ll examine the content more closely in the U (understand) Step. However, to prepare for the next step, we can also start opening or downloading software that will allow us to examine submission components and obtaining any resources we’ll need to help with the next step.

Common things to look for during this step are the record level metadata, file inventory, file organization, the README file, and whether the file can open or not :

<table border=1 frames=hsides rules=rows>
<tr>
<td><b>Completeness</b></td> 
<td><ul><li> Is the submission complete based on any predefined criteria for your repository? An example of predefined criteria is the Dryad repository guidelines.</li></ul></td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td><b>Record Level Metadata</b></td> 
<td><ul><li> Does the description have sufficient detail?</li>
<li>Are all required fields filled out? (e.g., title, author/creator, licensing) </li></ul></td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td><b>File inventory</b></td>
<td><ul><li> What files are included? </li>
<li> Are files missing? </li></ul></td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td><b>File organization</b></td>
<td><ul><li> Are there unwanted spaces or special characters?</li>
<li> Is there a file naming convention? </li>
<li> Order and description (if many files) </li>
<li> File hierarchy in terms you can clearly see the relationships in the naming of the files on the top level and the files below them in terms of how they are named (ex. School_data as a top level folder and school_data_ny as a folder in the school_data folder referring to school data from New York) . </li></ul></td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td><b>README</b></td>
<td><ul><li> Is there a documentation file, like a README?</li>
<li>Example: Cornell ReadMe Template </li></ul></td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td><b>Brief file diagnostic</b></td>
<td><ul><li> (software) Does this open? </li>
<li> (code) Does this run? </li>
<li> What version? </li></ul></td>
</tr>
