<h2>Learning Outcomes</h2>

<p>
<b>Curators will be able to:</b><br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;1. Identify the most important aspects of curation activities to request from data depositors.
   <br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;2. Formulate requests to get the information they need from depositors.
   <br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;3. Create sample or example emails to data depositors requesting specific curation activities.

<h2>Summary of the Request Step</h2>

  <p>
  The Request step is where you communicate with the depositor to address the gaps identified in Check and Understand steps.

  There are four main goals of the R step:

  <p>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;1. Establish a rapport with the depositor.
   <br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;2. Let the depositor know what changes and additions need to be made to the data deposit to make it as complete and understandable as possible.
   <br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;3. Encourage the depositor to supply missing information.
    <br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;4. Get permission to make any recommended changes to improve the quality of the dataset.

<h2>R Step Actions</h2>

<ol style=" padding-top: 1%; padding-bottom: 1%;padding-left: 5%;">
  <li>Establish Rapport: It may take more than one email
    <ul style=" padding-top: 1%; padding-bottom: 1%; padding-left: 5%;">
      <li>Start with a “thank you”</li>
      <li>It is easier to ask for supplemental information once rapport is established; initial email should be as brief and concise as possible.</li>
      <li>Offer to schedule a meeting if needed</li>
      <li>A little empathy goes a long way. Consider:
          <ul style="padding-top: 1%; padding-bottom: 1%;padding-left: 5%;">  
              <li>What are the depositor’s needs in depositing their dataset?</li>
              <li>This may be an opportunity for them to learn, and the beginning of a long-term relationship as they continue to deposit data in the repository: treat it like a collaboration.</li>
              <li>Keep in mind that the depositor may be under a tight time frame and may not have the time to make recommended improvements this time around.</li>
          </ul>
      </li>
    </ul>
  </li>
      <br>

  <li>Let the depositor know what changes and additions need to be made to the data to make it as complete and understandable as possible. Formulate your request for the depositor to respond.
      <ul style="padding-top: 1%; padding-bottom: 1%;padding-left: 5%;">
          <li>Explain what you need from the depositor, and why</li>
          <li>Prioritize your requests! Ask for information that is most important for the dataset quality first.</li>
      </ul>
        <br>
      <h4>Formulate your request for the depositor to respond</h4>
      <ul style="padding-top: 1%; padding-bottom: 1%;padding-left: 5%;">
          <li>Do you need additional information or permission from the depositor to take action? If so, make sure this ask is part of your request.</li>
          <li>Make your request as specific as possible. Provide examples and resources when relevant.</li>
          <li>Prioritize requests and recommendations according to what is most important for the quality of the dataset
                <ul style="padding-top: 1%; padding-bottom: 1%;padding-left: 5%;">
                    <li><b>Essential</b>: What information is critical to improve the quality of the dataset? (for example: missing README or metadata, files that won’t open or are missing extension information, errors found in data set)</li>
                    <li><b>Important</b>: What information is useful to improve the quality of the dataset? (for example, incomplete README or metadata, changes to file names)</li>
                    <li><b>Supplemental</b>: What information is helpful to improve the quality of the dataset? (for example: small edits recommended to improve clarity or increase FAIRness of data like ORCIDs, funding information, keywords)</li>

    <h4>&nbsp;Advice: Make it easy for depositors to respond</h4>
    <ul style="padding-top: 1%; padding-bottom: 1%;padding-left: 5%;">
        <li>Limit to four asks</li>
        <li>Be specific, but concise</li>
        <li>Keep it simple; ideally depositors could respond with a yes or no</li>
        <li>Provide resources where useful</li>

        <ul style="padding-top: 1%; padding-bottom: 1%;padding-left: 5%;">
            <li>Tell the depositor how they should get you the information</li>

              <li>If your request includes changes you would be able to make yourself (for example, changes to file names), ask for the researcher’s approval before making the changes</li>

<h2>Example Requests</h2>
<h4>University of Minnesota - Sample Email to Researcher</h4>
<h4>University of Michigan - Sample Email to Researcher</h4>
<br>

<blockquote  class = "highlighted-text">
<h2>Activity</h2>
<h4>Directions</h4>
<p>
Using the dataset and information gathered from the “C” and “U” step, draft an email to the depositor that continues to build rapport and requests the information you need to complete the data deposit. Please use the sample emails above to format your request email.
</p>
<br>
<h4>Active Reflection:</h4>
<p>
After writing your request, read the email as if you were the researcher receiving it. What might your reaction be? After considering the researcher’s point of view, would you change anything in your request and recommendations?
