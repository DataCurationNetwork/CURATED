Throughout the following lessons, a single dataset will be used for all activities. This dataset was deposited by an entomologist to their local data repository. This dataset contains experimental measurements documenting how honey bee colonies exposed to high temperatures maintain and meet the water needs of the colony to survive. From the link below you can access the full deposit which consists of a metadata form and a tabular file.
