Throughout the following lessons, a single dataset will be used for all activities. This dataset was deposited by an entomologist to their local data repository; it has been slightly simplified for the purposes of these lessons. The dataset contains experimental measurements documenting how honey bee colonies exposed to high temperatures maintain and meet the water needs of the colony to survive. We would like to thank the dataset authors for allowing us to use their work.

From the link below you can access the initial deposit which consists of a metadata form and a tabular file.
